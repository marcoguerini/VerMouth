# Countering Misinformation via Emotional Response Generation

Welcome to the VerMouth dataset repository! VerMouth is a dataset for the automatic generation of personalised responses to misleading claims online.
It was introduced in the paper [**Countering Misinformation via Emotional Response Generation**]() presented at the EMNLP 2023 conference.
If you use the VerMouth datasets or any partial sections of it in your work, we kindly request to [cite](https://github.com/marcoguerini/VerMouth/tree/main#bibtex-citation) our original paper.

# VerMouth
Vermouth dataset comprises ~12.000 entries. Each entry contains three elements:
- **claim**: factual statement under analysis;
- **fact-checking article**: the link to a journalistic document containing all the evidence needed to fact-check a claim;
- **verdict**: a short textual response to the claim which explains **why** it might be true or false.
- **style**: a label indicating the style or emotion expressed in the claim.

## Dataset Description

Starting from the FullFact dataset [(Russo et al., 2023)](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00601/117871/Benchmarking-the-Generation-of-Fact-Checking) we rewrote both the claims and the verdict according to a social communication style.
To this end, we adopted the author-reviewer pipeline [(TekiroÄŸlu et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.110/) which combines instruction-based Large Language Models and human post-editing.
A schema of our data collection strategy is depicted in the following image.

The final data were rewritten according to two styles: 
- **SMP style**: it resembles the style employed on social media platforms, in particular, Twitter style
- **Emotional style**: social media communication style with the addition of an **emotional component**. We adopted the six basic emotions from Paul Ekman, namely anger, surprise, disgust, enjoyment, fear, and sadness.

The following table presents the count of items for each subpart of the dataset.
